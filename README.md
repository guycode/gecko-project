## Gecko test app
 This was a great test and eye opener at the same time. I enjoyed it very much. please find my working demo at:
  https://guycode.github.io/gecko-project/
  **please  note that github pages may be a little behind on updating what is on the current master branch if changes were made less than 24 hours prior. 

## Issues

1- Validation - I wasn't able to integrate a check for the inputs, so they currently just logging in and work even if they are empty

2- Need to find alternative to using fetch for making the API call. It works as it is, but fetch is not compatible with all browswers so not a long term solution.

## Goal

Build out my own version of this test application using this repository as a starting point.

The end result should look and function just like the application included in the sample directory:

Sample App: https://gecko-designs.github.io/develop-for-gecko/sample/

You don't need to develop any of the signup/login functionality, a user should be able to continue to the Products list by submitting the form, they don't need to authenticate with any service.

You're free to use any solutions you see fit, there are plenty of intentional errors ranging from basic fixes to more complex problems that aren't readily apparent but easy to remedy.
